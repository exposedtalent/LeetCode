 HOW THE FLOYD'S AGORIRTHM WORKS IN SIMPLE MATH
    Algorithm: Assume non-cyclic length N and cyclic length M with index [0,M-1]

    <-  N  ->          1. When slow enters the cycle at 0 (◎), fast is at N (■)
            s
    □-□-□-□-◎-□-□-□    2. Fast is M-N behind, so they will meet at M-N (※)
            |     |
            □  M  ■ f  3. Cycle entrance is now M-(M-N) = N away, so if we
            |     |       make one pointer start over and both at slow speed,
            □-□-※-□       they will guarantee to meet again at 0 (◎)meet
